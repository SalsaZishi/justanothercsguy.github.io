Last night I attended a special Shabbat to remember a University of Miami student who passed away 3 years ago.
Eitan had only walked this Earth for 18 years, yet in this time he made many friends and pursued writing and ceramics.
I never met him, but the crowd of his fraternity brothers who gathered to honor this young man touched me. His
grandmother told stories of her grandson's humor and kindness. His mother recited a poem, a prayer to God for her son,
touching on the concepts of life and death. Her poem expressed so many emotions at once that the whole room hushed
under the sway of voice. Grief, Confusion, Disbelief, Indignation, Frustration, Resignation. Finally, a tinge of hope.
Consolation - her son has now passed on to the eternal. 

Then one fraternity brother came up and recited a poem called "The Dash", by Linda Ellis. The narrator of the poem 
sees a gravestone with two dates signifying birth and death, with a dash in the middle. The two dates matter not; 
it is the dash - how we spent our lives - that matters. The narrator calls on us to evaluate our lives and treat
each other with kindess. It ends with a thought-provoking statement: 

"So, when your eulogy is being read,
 with your life’s actions to rehash…
 would you be proud of the things they say
 about how you spent YOUR dash?"
 
Eitan's mother and grandmother also created a booklet containing some of writings. It was a rare experience to read
another person's writings. One excerpt stands out: 

"So the next time you walk by someone sitting alone, maybe try and go talk to them and form a new connection. 
 You never know, that person could be your new best friend or even your soul mate. Life's too short to be shy."
 
At the end of the dinner, I went over to the family of Eitan and complimented them on their arrangement of his 
writing exercepts, a glimpse into a life I never knew. Eitan's grandmother said that each life is like a world,
a shining nova, and when someone passes away it is as though a world has vanished, a sun has dimmed into the 
dark oblivion of the universe. 

Countless lives have come before us, and countless will continue to come after us. We will never know all their 
stories. Yet we should try as best as we can. There is so much we can do to make this world a better place. 
To start, we can smile more towards others. Smiles cost nothing, yet they are one of the greatest gifts. To smile
is to meet the eyes of another, unabashed, accepting them for who they are, and welcoming them into our world
of shared creation.
