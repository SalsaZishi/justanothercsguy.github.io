In the 1800s, a British mathematician named [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) came up with a 
new type of arithmetic that would become known as Boolean Algebra. Today, Boole's invention drives the circuitry 
of computers, allowing us to connect with each other almost instantaneously, create simulations of unheard-of worlds, 
perform calculations to predict the future, and more. So it seems natural that a Computer Science student, and even anyone
who uses a computer, should try to learn Boolean Algebra. 

Here are the main identities (math jargon for building blocks) of Boolean Algebra:
