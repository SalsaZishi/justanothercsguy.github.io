In 11 hours I will have to face my Computer Architecture exam. I have not studied much, nor do I plan to cram. Nor do 
I pray for time to stop. Nor do I reflect and curse myself for not preparing earlier. Three years ago, I could never 
imagine myself reacting this way towards an exam. 

Then, I was a high school junior taking 6 AP classes and running in my high school's varsity Cross Country team. Every 
day at 6am I would wake up, shower, eat breakfast, and carpool with friends. At 7:20am, my AP Physics class began, and
if anyone walked into that room they would've seen 20 weary teenagers whose sleep-deprivation amplied their confusion 
of the subject matter. In at least half of my classes, I would do homework for other classes or sleep. Some of my teachers 
didn'tappreciate my inattentivenss, so I had to be subtle. Some did not care, so I became a differential engine for 20 
minutes and then crashed. At lunch, I would walk around the school since my best friends were in different lunch periods,
and I didn't want to be seen eating alone. At 2:20pm, school ended and Cross Country practice started. 20 minutes of 
warm-up jogs and stretching, followed by 3-5 miles of running in 90 degree Farenheit weather. Running in Miami, Florida
from August to October was not a pleasant affair - humidity and heat bonuses to the usual shin splints that runners faced.
I was never existential in Cross Country, since all my energy was focused on finishing this torture as quickly as possible.

The races were an experience that I will never forget. We usually raced around Larry and Penny Park, which had a big lake
and acres of shrubs and trees. We would come an hour or two before the event and warm up while coach went to register us
for the race. They gave us these ID tags that we pinned to our jerseys. The first time I saw the uniform I had to wear,
I probably blushed - the pants were as short as Speedos! Added to the fact that I was not very fast, my first race would
have embarassed the heck out of me had I not been too tired to care by the end. 

The course began near a cluster of trees that lead to a gravel path with the lake to the left and shrubs to the right. 
People occasionally tripped on the gravel, so one had to be careful while maintaining a quick pace. The pack of 200 runners
would quickly separate - the elite would run the 5km in under 18 minutes, while I would elated if I reached anything near
22 minutes. After turning around and going to bush path, someone at the mile landmark would announce your first mile time.
One time I heard 6:15 and though that was amazing, considering that 2 years ago in PE I could barely run a mile in 8 minutes.
Between the first and second mile your legs would start to burn, but the trees kept things shady and you would cross a section
of road at the 1.5 mile mark where your teammates would cheer you on. I appreciated how the race course designers set up many
points where teammates could wait at and cheer you on, and of course I appreciated my teammates for being there. Sometimes,
other high schools would cheer me as well - a great thing, since everyone was suffering through the same pains. At the 2 mile
mark, the canopy of trees disappeared into small shrubs and your mettle came out. Controlled breathing and playing music in 
my head were my tactics to pushing through the unforgiving summer heat. Legs, lungs, eyes - every part of the body burned. 
As Thomas Paine said, *"these are the times that try men's souls."* After escaping hell, the cool lake appeared and it dawned
on me that we had a figure eight around the park. This last half mile was even worse than the previous since everyone behind
was trying to get in front, and everyone in front was trying to keep them back. You could hear the cheers of the hundreds of 
runners, friends, parents, and coaches - a necessary morale boost to push the gas pedal to the max. 

This was at once my favorite and least favorite part of the race. On one hand, you hear so many people cheering and feel like
a champ if you manage to catch someone who was in front of you. On the other hand, you had to give all you had left, and 
sometimes that was not enough to prevent the guy behind you from overlapping you. In my first race, I got overlapped at the 
last 200m - I gave it everything, but he was simply faster. In my next races, I worked hard to make sure that didn't happen
again and by junior year I routinely overlapped the guy in front of me. In my last race, I managed to run a 21:15 - a decent
middle of the pack time, but for me it seemed like a miracle. In my senior year, I didn't want to suffer anymore, so I told
my coach of my resignation.

After practice, I would come home, shower, and knock out for an hour. Then I would wake up around 6pm, do some homework, and
eat dinner at 7pm. Then I would walk around my neighborhood for about 2 laps, a habit my grandfather taught me to help with
digestion. Then do some more homework while procrasting every once in half an hour by watching YouTube or playing videogames.
I would get my homework for AP Calculus BC, AP Physics B, AP US History, AP Human Geography, AP Chemistry, and AP English
Language done around midnight. Then fall asleep and wake up at 6am the next day to repeat the cycle over again. Thus my 
junior year passed. Around March, after taking ~30 practice tests, I took the SAT and scored in the 99.9th percentile. Things
were looking pretty good - sure my schedule *completely sucked*, but hey, I was on my way to a prestgious college and lots of 
money in the future, eh? So I continued grinding away, scoring 5's on all my AP exams except for Chemistry (4). Then came the 
summer, where I goofed off playing videogames, hanged out with friends, and enrolled in an online AP Computer Science course 
that would eventually change the course of my life.

Senior year came and I took 7 AP classes since Physics C in my school was composed of both Electricity + Magnetism and 
Mechanics. Two years later, a sophomore in college, if you asked me what I did in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus,
Differential Equations, English Language, English Literature, AP ____ History, etc. - I wouldn't be able to tell you. I could
recite a few memorable poems such as "Carpe Diem" or "She Walks in Beauty Like the Night" and tell you how I wrote about 
"The Age of Innocence", by Edith Wharton, for my AP English Literature exam, even though my teacher explicitly told us to 
stick to writing about the novels he assigned us in class. I argued that Newland Archer's relationship with Madame Olenska
bordered on incest since Ollenska was the cousin of Newland's wife May. Somehow I got a 5 on that exam.

Well, everyone in my graduating class was stressing about college applications, even the one's who had done literally 
everything right. I never felt comfortable running as president of a school club - I tried and failed for smaller positions
such as secretary or vice president. There were kids in my school who had done a varsity sport, been president of an academic
club for 2 years, done 10+ AP classes, scored above a 2200 on the SAT, played instrument(s), took summer classes at a local
community college to boost their GPA's, volunteered or did research at hospitals, and I don't know how many other things.
I did most but not all those things, and my college application essays were not the best. I didn't feel like hiring someone
to proofread the essay or spend two months researching about a college so that I could bullshit how much I wanted to major
in this subject, minor in that subject, do research with Prof. X in the Y department, and run Z club. I applied to Stanford,
Columbia, Cornell, UPenn, MIR, Rice, UMiami, UFlorida, and a few others. The prestige and non-freezing weather of Stanford,
along with its world-renowned Computer Science department, allured me, but my chances were slim as its acceptance rate was 5%
and I lacked the money/connections/extraordinary-talent that would get me in the door. Some might say here that I'm making 
excuses, but damn, I really tried and busted my ass off in high school, and this day, when I reflect on it, *I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I DID IT.* The prestige or guaranteed good education/career seems like a mirage that I hopelessly chased. Well, I didn't
get into Stanford. No problem, says I, Cornell has a 14% acceptance and Rice an 18% acceptance rate, and I clearly stand out
more than their average candidate. 

Life is funny. When I toured the University of Miami in my senior year, I thought to myself: "this is my last choice." I will
only go if all the top 20 colleges I applied to reject me, and surely that won't happen. What did I learn? *Never say never!*

On the night before my colleges would release their decisions, I found a TedTalk where the speaker discussed an addiction to 
something I previously thought was innoculous. Imagine my surprise when I put two and two together and realized that I was an
addict to something that most teenage males take as a given in our modern world of high speed internet connection. The next
day, I found out I had been rejected by UPenn, Columbia, and Rice. Cornell only waitlisted me. 

I believe I snapped. During the next month I battled by addiction and became very pessimistic, directing my thoughts to the
idea that colleges judge Asian applicants against high standards than their non-Asian peers. To this day, I still hold this
belief, but I don't concentrate on it anymore - I merely accept it as a part of life and move on. But April was a hectic 
month: how my mind cried when it couldn't numb itself with dopamine from the abysms of the internet! It didn't help that 
those around me had dates to the prom or that I had chances in the past but was too shy to act on them. I ultimately opted
not to go and the next two months seemed like I was going nowhere.
