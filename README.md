For 20 years I have received help from the world. Now I want to give back in some way.

My goal for this website is to explain Computer Architecture, and later other Computer Science classes, 
in an interesting yet lucid manner. In the process, this will motivate me to learn and present the material 
for my classes and do some basic web design.
